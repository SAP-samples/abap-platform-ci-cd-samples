# Build add-ons on a transient ABAP Environment system

[back to main](https://github.com/SAP-samples/abap-platform-ci-cd-samples/tree/main)

## Description

Please refer to the [documentation](https://sap.github.io/jenkins-library/scenarios/abapEnvironmentAddons/) for more details about the scenario.

In this example a **transient** add-on assembly system is being used and the system **is deleted** in the [Post stage](https://www.project-piper.io/pipelines/abapEnvironment/stages/post/).
Software components are imported into the system by using the [`Clone` strategy](https://www.project-piper.io/pipelines/abapEnvironment/stages/cloneRepositories/#stage-parameters).

### Pipeline Stages

![ABAP Environment Build Pipeline](https://www.project-piper.io/images/abapEnvironmentBuildPipeline.png "ABAP Environment Build Pipeline")

#### [Initial Checks](https://www.project-piper.io/pipelines/abapEnvironment/stages/initialChecks/)
- Check the validity of defined addon product version
- Check the validity of defined software component versions

#### [Prepare System](https://www.project-piper.io/pipelines/abapEnvironment/stages/prepareSystem/)
- Preparing a system for add-on assembly
- Creating a Communication Arrangement for the Scenario SAP_COM_0510 via a service key in the assembly system

#### [Clone Repositories](https://www.project-piper.io/pipelines/abapEnvironment/stages/cloneRepositories/)
- Switch between branches of a git repository on a SAP Cloud Platform ABAP Environment system
- Clone software components relevant for the add-on build

#### [ATC](https://www.project-piper.io/pipelines/abapEnvironment/stages/ATC/)
- Check software components to be assembled as part of the add-on build via ABAP Test Cockpit (Check Variant: SAP_CLOUD_PLATFORM_ATC_DEFAULT)

**Note**: The ATC results are displayed using the [Warnings Next Generation Plugin](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/warnings-ng/#warnings-next-generation-plugin). If you don't want to use this plugin - or if it's not available on your Jenkins server - leave out the extension for the ATC stage (.pipeline/extensions/ATC.groovy).

#### [Build](https://www.project-piper.io/pipelines/abapEnvironment/stages/build/)
  * Creating a Communication Arrangement for the Scenario SAP_COM_0582 via a service key in the assembly system
  * Determine the ABAP delivery packages (name and type) to be created as part of the add-on build
  * Assembly of installation, support package or patch in in the assembly system
  * Upload resulting SAR archives and creating physical delivery packages in in the File Content Management System of SAP
  * Create a target vector for software lifecycle operations
  * Release the physical delivery packages
  * Trigger publication of the target vector with test scope

#### [Integration Tests](https://www.project-piper.io/pipelines/abapEnvironment/stages/integrationTest/)
  * Preparing a system for the add-on test installation, system is deprovisioned after successful testing has been confirmed

#### [Confirm](https://www.project-piper.io/pipelines/abapEnvironment/stages/confirm/)
Release Decision

#### [Publish](https://www.project-piper.io/pipelines/abapEnvironment/stages/publish/)
  * After confirmation: Trigger publication of the target vector with production scope

#### [Post](https://www.project-piper.io/pipelines/abapEnvironment/stages/post/)
  * After successful pipeline execution: assembly system is deleted

## Configuration
### [.pipeline/config.yml](.pipeline/config.yml)
Based on the [pipeline configuration default values](https://github.com/SAP/jenkins-library/blob/master/resources/com.sap.piper/pipeline/abapEnvironmentPipelineStageDefaults.yml) a configuration file .pipeline/config.yml is used to provide all required values to run the pipeline.
